# Quantra Python Environments

This repository contains `.yml` files to help you set up Python environments for seamless dependency management in Quantra projects. Use these files to create and activate Python environments with all the necessary packages pre-installed.

For detailed guidance, refer to the [Setting Up Python On Your System](https://blog.quantinsti.com/set-up-python-system/) blog.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Python Environment

1. **Create a New Environment from the `.yml` File**:
   - Open the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).
   - Navigate to the directory containing the desired `.yml` file.
   - Run the following command to create the environment (replace `environment.yml` with the correct file name):
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     ```
   - Alternatively, if using the `.yml` file directly from a URL:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/<file>.yml
     ```

2. **Activate the New Environment**:
   - Activate the environment with:
     ```bash
     conda activate <environment_name>
     ```
   - Replace `<environment_name>` with the name specified in the `.yml` file.

3. **Verify the Environment**:
   - Check if the environment is created successfully by listing all environments:
     ```bash
     conda env list
     ```
